# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Add this information to your README.

## Feature #1: Display Images
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the photo gallery should display all of the beasts' images in the gallery.
How are we implementing it?
The Main component should pass props for the title, image and description to each HornedBeast component. You will find this information in the provided JSON file.

## Feature #2: Allow Users to Favorite Individual Beasts
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to be able to interact with the site and favorite beasts.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When a user clicks on an image of a beast
Then the number of "Favorites" displayed on that beast will increase by one.
How are we implementing it?
Create state inside of the HornedBeast component that keeps track of the number of times each beast has been favorited.

Put a heart in each HornedBeast component with the number of “Favorites” next to it.

## Feature 3: Bootstrap
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to see a visually pleasing application that is also reponsive when I view this application on different screen sizes.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the images are displayed on the screen
Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way: in columns, as screen width allows.
How are we implementing it?
Bring in the react-bootstrap library and use it to style your application making sure that it is responsive.
Stretch Goal: Add Interaction
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to be able to interact with each item on the page.
What are we going to implement?
    Given that a user opens the application in the browser
    When a user clicks on an item other than the horned beasts, such as the title of the page or the footer,
    Then the information and styles should change.
How are we implementing it?
When the user clicks on elements such as the header, footer or title of page, make something change using state.
You can update the words, change the styles or add something new. Be creative.
